Hi, this is my first personal blog text. I created it to training my English and tell about my life on the day. Today is Thursday, and my day begins with myself wake up at 6 am. I was very excited because today I would meeting with Fernando (my new supervisor on my doctorate). Maybe in the future, I tell more about him, but now I will focus on the meeting. He told me I need to practice more English (this is why I created this personal blog) and I need to finish my Ph.D. level know my English at fluency level. I know It will be very hard (this text proves this). However, I wanted to become the best in the compiler area, so I will try hard in this. He spoke to train my listening too, for this there are two ways. The first one is I see series or movies in English without subtitles. The second one is to read and listening books in English at the same time (looking I choose the Invisible Man by H. G. Wells, It isn’t an easy book for beginners because there are a lot of words I unknowkn, but I finish him soon… maybe I tell about the history in the future in this blog). So, I little tired to write more. So I will go to sleep now. I hope to see you tomorrow.
