<p>Hi everybody,</p>

<p>That's me again. Today I feel the hard choice in life. If you don’t know, currently I over change the PhD. I was at UFV, but I switched to UFMG. This change does not impact my life directly yet because we stay in a pandemic, and the two institutions are working in social distance. I changed the area, worked with Computer Architecture, and now I will work with Compiler. At first moment you can think I'm a crazy man, but I’m normal (I guess...). In both areas, there are several opportunities to research. My motive was I would like to become more complete as a computer scientist. To become a more complete person it is necessary to bring challenges and your life and definitely going to UFMG was the best choice, but it’s not easy to stay there, they hope the best student and definitely I will become one in a day. There is not a person that you do motivate all day when you are tired, I need to become my own motivation to finish the phd. Yeah, this blog brings peace and happiness ath same time, I feel relaxed and at the same time train my writing. Now I will study listening before I go to bed.</p>

<p>See you tomorrow, I hope everything is good with you…</p>
